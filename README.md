Tezos
=====

The entire development happens at https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos
Github is a mirror that does not represent the current development.

Tezos is a distributed consensus platform with meta-consensus
capability. Tezos not only comes to consensus about the state of its ledger,
like Bitcoin or Ethereum. It also attempts to come to consensus about how the
protocol and the nodes should adapt and upgrade.

 - Developer documentation is available online at http://doc.tzalpha.net
 - The page https://www.tezos.com/ contains more information about the
   project, even though it is frozen in time due to external reasons
