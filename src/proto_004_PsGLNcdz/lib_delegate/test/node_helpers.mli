(** [fork_node ()] forks a node in sandbox mode listening to rpc on
    `localhost:port` (where the default port is 18732) and returns the
    PID of the forked process. It waits `timeout` seconds (default 4)
    before to return and it may fails with an exception whenever the node
    died during the wait.  *)
